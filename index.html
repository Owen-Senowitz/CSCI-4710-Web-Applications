    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I've spent the past 2022 summer working as a Software Engineer Intern for Lowes on the pricing team. I learned a ton of new information about Java, Springboot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Couchbase. During the school year at East Carolina University I'm a full time Computer Science student and a part time Assistant Software Engineer for the College of Nursing.</p>
    <h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
    <p>I chose Computer Science because ever sense I was little I have loved playing video games. I then start wondering how can I make money from playing games? I then started creating game servers for this game called Arma 3. I made a good amount of money for a 12 year old running those servers. I have fell in love with Computer Science ever since.</p>
    <h3>Why I Chose This Class?</h3>
    <p>I chose this class because I have a lot of knowledge about web development and I think it will be a easy grade for me.</p>
